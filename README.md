# Tips
pyinstaller will encrease the detection rate. use this version only:   
`pip install pyinstaller==3.1.1`  

backdoor doesnt auto-activate the persistence module for better evation chance, if you want to change that simply uncomment  
the self.persistance() line in backdoor file.  

for list of commnads type 'help' in the listener console when connected to the backdoor.   

tkinter most be installed by default, otherwise install it with:  
`apt install python-tk`  

the `enum` command results will be saved in the listener directory. to see colored output use `cat enum*.txt`
